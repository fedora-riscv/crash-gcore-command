Subject: [PATCH] coredump: fix building failure due to undefined macros
 MAPLE_TREE_{COUNT,GATHER}

As of the commit 13794ace3830bf0274fe7b2e0e579ad72e31848f (coredump:
fix failure of executing gcore command due to introduction of maple
tree management on vma list), gcore.so fails to get built with the
following error messages with defs.h without maple tree API support:

    libgcore/gcore_coredump.c:189:50: error: ‘MAPLE_TREE_COUNT’ undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean ‘RADIX_TREE_COUNT’?
      189 |                 entry_num = do_maple_tree(mm_mt, MAPLE_TREE_COUNT, NULL);
	  |                                                  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	  |                                                  RADIX_TREE_COUNT
    libgcore/gcore_coredump.c:189:50: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
    libgcore/gcore_coredump.c:191:38: error: ‘MAPLE_TREE_GATHER’ undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean ‘RADIX_TREE_GATHER’?
      191 |                 do_maple_tree(mm_mt, MAPLE_TREE_GATHER, entry_list);
	  |                                      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	  |                                      RADIX_TREE_GATHER

This is caused by the missing macros MAPLE_TREE_COUNT and
MAPLE_TREE_GATHER.

To fix the issue, define the two macros within crash gcore so that
build is successfully done expecting the resulting binary works well
when it is ran against new crash utility that has maple tree API
support.
